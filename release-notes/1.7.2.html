<h2>Version 1.7.2 — 3D Page Turn Animation</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>New:</strong> Realistic 3D page turn animation in the book reader — pages fold and lift like a real book instead of sliding between views</li>
  <li><strong>New:</strong> Directional page turns — forward flips the current page off to reveal the next, backward folds the previous page back in from the spine</li>
  <li><strong>New:</strong> Story Info sheet in the reader toolbar — view the original concept, format, style, characters, and full story metadata at a glance</li>
  <li><strong>Changed:</strong> Each page is now a self-contained book page card with its own paper background, so the entire surface rotates as one unit during turns</li>
  <li><strong>Changed:</strong> Original story concept is now saved with each storybook and available when reopening from the library</li>
</ul>
