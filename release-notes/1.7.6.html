<h2>Version 1.7.6 — Smarter Illustrations</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>New:</strong> Each story detail — character, setting, action, mood — is now sent as a separate concept to the image engine for sharper, more faithful illustrations</li>
  <li><strong>New:</strong> If an image fails to generate, StoryFox progressively simplifies the prompt while keeping the main character intact</li>
  <li><strong>Improved:</strong> Better breed-specific rendering for dog and cat characters</li>
</ul>
